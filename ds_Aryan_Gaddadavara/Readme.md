## Overview

This project investigates how the Fear & Greed Index influences actual cryptocurrency trading activity.  
All data processing, merging, sentiment labeling, and visual analysis were conducted in a Google Colab environment.

The study evaluates whether traders behave differently under various sentiment conditions such as Extreme Greed, Greed, Neutral, Fear, and Extreme Fear.  
Key behavioral metrics include position size, trade volume, price distribution, buy vs sell patterns, and profitability variation.

## Analysis Description

The project examines whether trader decisions exhibit measurable changes when market sentiment shifts.  
The analysis focuses on:

- Position size variation (tokens)  
- Differences in trade volume (USD)  
- Buy vs Sell behavior patterns  
- Execution price distributions  
- Profitability (Closed PnL) behavior  
- Sentiment frequency distributions  

All insights are supported by plots saved in the outputs/ folder.

## Visualizations Generated(outputs)

The exploratory data analysis produces the following charts:

- Average Position Size vs Market Sentiment  
- Average Trade Volume vs Market Sentiment  
- Buy vs Sell Count Comparison Across Sentiments  
- Execution Price Distribution Across Sentiments  
- Profitability (Closed PnL) Distribution Across Sentiments  
- Sentiment Frequency Bar Chart  

These figures illustrate how traders respond when market psychology shifts toward fear or greed.
